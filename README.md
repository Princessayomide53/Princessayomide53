If you’ve stumbled across this page, you’re probably wondering who I am — so here’s the quick scoop:

## 👩‍🔬 From Biochemistry to Building Beautiful Interfaces

I graduated from **Oduduwa University**, where I studied Biochemistry. While science taught me discipline and curiosity, my passion led me to tech — specifically, **Frontend Web Development**. Today, I bring ideas to life through code, creativity, and a whole lot of enthusiasm.

## ✨ What I'm Like to Work With

I'm someone who:
- Loves learning new things (tech or not!)
- Pays close attention to the little details that make a big difference
- Cares about clean, accessible, and user-friendly design
- Believes teamwork, honesty, and a good attitude go a long way
- Can switch between strategic thinking and hands-on building — comfortably

Whether I’m debugging code or brainstorming ideas, I always bring energy and intention to what I do.

## 🤝 Let’s Build Something Together

Right now, I'm:
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate on **Fullstack web development**
- ✨ Curious about **creating stunning web animations**
- 💬 Happy to chat about anything **Frontend-related**

## 💡 A Little Extra About Me

- 👩‍💻 I enjoy building things that feel good to use
- 😄 Pronouns: *she/her*
- 📺 Fun fact: I’m a huge **anime** fan (seriously, don’t get me started unless you have time 😂).
